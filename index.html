      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Mexico City, Mexico</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Guitar, music (rock, grunge, metal, progressive, blues, jazz, fusion), videogames, weight training/fitness, snowboarding, skateboarding, soccer and having a great time with my family and friends</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I would like to become a Software Developer for a global company</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Mexico City</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Because I've always been intrigued by programming languages and how they work (especially the logic behind them). I'm also very interested in web development because my current goal is to make a career change, to a field that requires constant learning and high technical skills. Finally, since I'm a complete beginner in web development, this coding bootcamp will be the best challenge for my professional and personal growth.</p>
